# Loan-Recovery-System
A machine learning project that analyzes and predicts loan recovery strategies using borrower and loan data. The system segments borrowers into risk groups, predicts the likelihood of default, and recommends tailored recovery actions. This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and popular data science libraries.
